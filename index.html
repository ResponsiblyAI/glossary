In a governance context, accountability refers to the obligation of an individual or organisation to account for its activities, to complete a deliverable or task, to accept the responsibility for those activities, deliverables or tasks, and to disclose the results in a transparent manner.</dd>

                        <dd>Closeness of computations or estimates to the exact or true values that the statistics were intended to measure. The goal of an AI model is to learn patterns that generalise well for unseen data. It is important to check if a trained AI model is performing well on unseen examples that have not been used for training the model. To do this, the model is used to predict the answer on the test dataset and then the predicted target is compared to the actual answer. The concept of accuracy is used to evaluate the predictive capability of the AI model. Informally, accuracy is the fraction of predictions the model got right. A number of metrics are used in machine learning (ML) to measure the predictive accuracy of a model. The choice of the accuracy metric to be used depends on the ML task.</dd>

Discrimination biases can also emerge due to technical limitations in hardware or software, or the use of an AI system that, due to its context of application, does not treat all groups equally. Discriminatory biases can also emerge in the very context in which the AI system is used. As many forms of biases are systemic and implicit, they are not easily controlled or mitigated and require specific governance and other similar approaches.</dd>

LLMs can be classed into two types: generative or discriminatory. Generative LLMs are models that output text, such as the answer to a question or even writing an essay on a specific topic. They are typically unsupervised or semi-supervised learning models that predict what the response is for a given task. Discriminatory LLMs are supervised learning models that usually focus on classifying text, such as determining whether a text was made by a human or AI.</dd>
